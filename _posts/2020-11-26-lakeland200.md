A 200km MTB loop around Lake District in the UK. I'm not a local and information is very hard to come by. Thus I decided to compile whatever I come across. This is the result (I'll keep it updated as I encounter new info). Please let me know if I'm missing something relevant that could be listed here. Thanks!
