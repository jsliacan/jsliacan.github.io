# Computer stuff

* [PermLab](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/malbert/permlab.php): a Java package doing various permutation pattern tasks -- very useful for enumeration of permutation classes and other explorations. Written mainly by Michael Albert.
* [Flagmatic](http://jsliacan.github.com/flagmatic/): a package for flag algebras computations on graphs, 3-regular hypergraphs, digraphs, and multigraphs. Written by Emil Vaughan, updated and modified by me.
* [Permpack](http://jsliacan.github.com/permpack/): a package for flag algebras computations on permutations that I wrote.

# Running

I like long runs in the mountains, preferably with many technical parts and a lot of altitude gain. Here's a list of a few races that I liked for some reason.

* [GlenCoe Skyline](http://www.skylinescotland.com/): definitely the most interesting race I ever did. Very technical, and very tough.
* [3x3000 80K Ultra](http://www.highterrainevents.co.uk/#!3x3000-/cfib): a very nice course. Anything happening in the Lakes will be spectacular.
* [A Coventry Way Challenge](http://www.acoventryway.org.uk/): a circular 'walk' around Coventry. Pretty long and flat, but was worth doing as the route is very logical.
* [Peak Skyline](http://www.peakskyline.co.uk): a 47k loop in the south-west part of the Peak District. It is a well-organised small race (150 participants). The course is quite technical underfoot byt very runnable. It also takes in 2000m of ascent.
* [Non-stop run through Low Tatras](http://nonstopbehnt.sk/): only 45k long, but follows a mountain range with great views if weather plays along. Very runnable up to a few steep ascents (2400m in total).

I once tried to run the [Peak District North-to-South](http://www.strava.com/activities/142296718), but I quit in Heathersage after 67K. So that's still a project I'd like to do. Other logical runs that I'd like to do in the UK include crossing Brecon Beacons West-to-East, and completing [Bob Graham Round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Graham_Round) in the Lake District. 

# Cycloross (CX)
I recently took up some cyclocross racing. It's a great deal of fun, which I did not expect having only ridden mountain bikes before.
