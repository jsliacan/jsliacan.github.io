# Computer stuff

* [PermLab](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/malbert/permlab.php): a Java package doing various permutation pattern tasks -- very useful for enumeration of permutation classes and other explorations. Written mainly by Michael Albert.
* [Flagmatic](http://jsliacan.github.com/flagmatic/): a package for flag algebras computations on graphs, 3-regular hypergraphs, digraphs, and multigraphs. Written by Emil Vaughan, updated and modified by me.
* [Permpack](http://jsliacan.github.com/permpack/): a package for flag algebras computations on permutations that I wrote.

# Running

I like long runs in the mountains, preferably with many technical parts and a lot of altitude gain. Here's a list of a few races that I liked for some reason.

* [GlenCoe Skyline](http://www.skylinescotland.com/): definitely the most interesting race I ever did. Very technical, and very tough.
* [3x3000 80K Ultra](http://www.highterrainevents.co.uk/#!3x3000-/cfib): a very nice course. Anything happening in the Lakes will be spectacular.
* [A Coventry Way Challenge](http://www.acoventryway.org.uk/): a circular 'walk' around Coventry. Pretty long and flat, but was worth doing as the route is very logical.
* [Peak Skyline](http://www.peakskyline.co.uk): a 47k loop in the south-west part of the Peak District. It is a well-organised small race (150 participants). The course is quite technical underfoot but very runnable. It also takes in 2000m of ascent.
* [Non-stop run through Low Tatras](http://nonstopbehnt.sk/): only 45k long, but follows a mountain range with great views if weather plays along. Very runnable up to a few steep ascents (2400m in total).

# Cycling

**Done**
* [SRMR](https://silkroadmountainrace.cc): in 2019 I tried this _ultra-endurance bikepacking_ offroad race and liked it a fair bit. The Silk Road Mountain Race takes place in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan (vast and high). It's not a gravel race, and that's a good thing. Offroad sections are often proper MTB and sometimes even hiking. Altitude increases the difficulty (up to 4000m). Visit my [race report](http://jakubsliacan.eu/srmr/2019/09/03/srmrno2_3.html) to read a lengthy version of my experience. 

**Maybes**
* [HT550](https://highlandtrail550.weebly.com/): I'll try to do this loop in Scotland in 2021.
* [AMR](https://atlasmountainrace.cc/): tempting for the cycling, although looks a bit too much like a gravel race. Not sure about the culture (and the fact that the place is not that friendly to participating women). Maybe 2022.
* Bohemia Divide: sounds like a nice 3-day effort across Czech Republic. Racing through places I know from some time ago could be a nice feeling.
* Slovakia Divide: I hear something to this effect is in preparation. Doing a race where I rode the bike as a kid would be unique. 
* [Tour Divide](https://tourdivide.org/): seems to be the original one. Conflicted about taking part after the 2019 events. They left bitter taste. Maybe I'll do one run at some later point.
