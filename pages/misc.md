# Computer stuff

* [PermLab](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/staffpriv/malbert/permlab.php): a Java package doing various permutation pattern tasks -- very useful for enumeration of permutation classes and other explorations. Written mainly by Michael Albert.
* [Flagmatic](http://jsliacan.github.io/flagmatic/): a package for flag algebras computations on graphs, 3-regular hypergraphs, digraphs, and multigraphs. Written by Emil Vaughan, updated and modified by me.
* [Permpack](http://jsliacan.github.io/permpack/): a package for flag algebras computations on permutations that I wrote.
